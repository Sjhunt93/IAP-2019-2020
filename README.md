### Unit Test assessments

Certain exercises in the tutorials are important milestones along your journey learning C++ and will be assessed. Aserve can automatically test your iapProj programs for certain tutorial exercises to see if your solution responds in the expected way. Check the following link for more info.

# Applications 

### Aserve 2.0
is a light weight audio client that contains a number of basic audio generating functions as well as provide MIDI input/output.

### Codebook
Codebook is a application for storing the solutions to each exercise.

# iapProj code

You will write all of your code for tutorials in a project called `iapProj`. This is a pre-configured xcode/visual studio project which includes all the files needed (including JUCE 5) to control and co-operate with Aserve. See the `iapProj/Builds` folder for MacOS Xcode and Windows Visual Studio compatible project files.
